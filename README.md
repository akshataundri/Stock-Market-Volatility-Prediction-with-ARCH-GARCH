# 📈 GARCH Volatility Modeling Project

## 📌 Overview
This project applies the **GARCH(1,1) model** to model and forecast volatility in financial time series data.  
The notebook demonstrates:

- Data loading and preprocessing (using Yahoo Finance or CSV input)  
- Log return calculation  
- GARCH(1,1) volatility estimation  
- Conditional volatility vs realized volatility comparison  
- Multi-day volatility forecasting  
- Exporting results for reporting  

This is useful for **risk management, trading strategies, and financial analytics**.

## ⚙️ Installation

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/superstore-analysis.git
cd superstore-analysis


## 📊 Usage

### Run the Jupyter Notebook
```bash
jupyter notebook GARCH_Starter_Notebook.ipynb
```

The notebook will:
- Load financial data (Yahoo Finance or CSV)  
- Compute log returns  
- Estimate **GARCH(1,1)** volatility  
- Plot and compare volatility with realized volatility  
- Forecast volatility for the next `N` days  
- Save results as `.csv` files

## 🧾 Key Outputs

### 1. Conditional Volatility (GARCH 1,1)
Daily and annualized volatility from the model.

### 2. Realized Volatility
21-day rolling window standard deviation of returns.

### 3. Forecasted Volatility
`garch_forecast.csv` contains next-`N` days volatility forecasts.

### 4. Volatility Comparison
`volatility_comparison.csv` compares **GARCH vs Realized** annualized volatility.
